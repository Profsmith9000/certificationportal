# Key Security

This guide page will go over some general tips regarding key security.

•Backup your private keys onto a text file, seperate directory, flash drive, or even a Google Doc.
•These backups should only be accessable by you and cannot be very easily accessed by another.
•It is typically a good idea to have at least two key backups, each in a different place.
