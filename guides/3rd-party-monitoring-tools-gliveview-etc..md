# 3rd Party Monitoring Tools \(gLiveview, etc.\)

If you've used prereqs.sh, you can skip this part, as this is already set up for you. The tool relies on the common env configuration file. To get current epoch blocks, the logMonitor.sh script is needed (and can be combined with CNCLI). This is optional and Guild LiveView will function without it.
